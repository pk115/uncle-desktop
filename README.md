- Each one has their own personality, lines and poses
- **View:** full body, or upper body to see their face
- **Size:** several sizes to choose from
- **Import your own:** from your own atlas image. See [CHARACTERS.md](docs/CHARACTERS.md) and [ADD_YOUR_CHARACTER.md](docs/ADD_YOUR_CHARACTER.md)

### 🏙 Life on your desktop

- **Sits on your windows:** perches on window edges and follows them when they move
- **Drag and toss:** drag her, throw her, and she falls with gravity
- **Wanders when idle:** walks around, peeks from screen edges, or rides your cursor
- **Resting spot:** her corner, or sitting on the taskbar (the Dock on a Mac)
- **Several screens:** she notices when a screen is plugged in, unplugged or moved
- **Biochip:** Ctrl+Alt+C tucks her into a small chip in the corner
- **Jealous:** she gets jealous when ChatGPT, Gemini or another AI is in front
- **Reacts to your computer:** looks at your screen now and then and comments on it
- **Window effects:** she can "possess" your windows
- **Sync:** a bond that grows as you spend time together

### 💬 Chat and her brain

- **Brains:**
  - Ollama on your computer, which setup can install for you
  - OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, DeepSeek
  - Pollinations, free with no key
  - Any OpenAI-compatible server
- **Three brain tiers:** NORMAL (fast), HIGHER (balanced), MAX INTELLIGENCE, picked from your provider's models
- **Memory:**
  - `personality.md`: you write who she is
  - `me.md`: she writes what she learns about you as you chat
- **Keys:** API keys are encrypted with your user account
- **Languages:** Thai first, plus English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian

### 🔊 Her voice

| Service | Runs | Thai | Notes |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| Your computer's voices | locally | ✓ if installed | Windows SAPI or macOS `say` |
| Edge TTS | online | ✓ | Premwadee / Niwat, no key |
| **Kokoro** | **locally, free** | ✗ | English, Japanese, Chinese and more; ~90 MB model downloaded once |
| OpenAI | online | ✓ | API key |
| ElevenLabs | online | ✓ | eleven_v3, any Voice ID |
| Fish Audio | online | ✓ | your cloned voices too |
| Your own server | wherever it is | depends on the model | OpenAI-compatible, e.g. Kokoro-FastAPI or your own model |

- **Voice effects:**
  - Pitch: ±12 semitones
  - Robot
  - Glitch: short dropouts
  - Layers: two more copies of her voice, one higher, one lower
- **Reads chat replies aloud** if you want, with her mouth moving to her voice

### 🎙 Voice commands

- **Listening:** push-to-talk (Ctrl+Alt+V), or a wake phrase you set, such as "เฮ้ อังเคิล", checked on your computer
- **Speech to text:**
  - Local Whisper: small, or Thonburian medium tuned for Thai
  - Gemini or OpenAI
- **Follow-up:** keep talking after waking her; she confirms risky steps and you can answer yes or no by voice
- **ElevenLabs Voice Agent:** continuous conversation you can interrupt, with 13 categories of app tools. See [VOICE_AGENT_TH.md](docs/VOICE_AGENT_TH.md)
- The mic starts off every launch. See [VOICE_COMMANDS_TH.md](docs/VOICE_COMMANDS_TH.md)

### 🤖 The AI agent: computer control

Ask for jobs in plain words, such as *"open Notepad and type a shopping list"*. She reads the window, plans, and works step by step, up to 30 steps per job.

- **Sees:** buttons, fields and text in your windows (UI Automation on Windows, Accessibility on Mac), plus a picture of the window if you allow it
- **Does:** click, double/right click, drag, type Thai, shortcuts, scroll, and switch, minimize or close windows
- **Longer jobs:**
  - waits for text to appear
  - notes what she read to use in a later step
  - opens several apps in one job
- **Games:** `hold_and_press`, such as holding W while pressing Space
- **Web pages:** rejects cookie banners, closes popups, looks things up on Google, and picks a song or video herself when you leave the choice to her
- **Talk to her mid-job:** type or say something while she works; she says "got it" and takes it into her next step
- **Her neon cursor:** glides to each spot just before she clicks
- **Proof before "done":** visible evidence on screen, or a second check by a vision model
- **Stop any time:** Esc or Ctrl+Alt+X

**Four security levels + ten switches**

| Level | What she does without asking |
|---|---|
| **Lockdown** | reads only, no clicks or typing |
| **Guarded** (recommended) | asks before anything with an effect: send, save, delete |
| **Trusted** | asks only about money, deleting, installing and power |
| **Blackwall** | never asks |

Every level can be fine-tuned with ten switches. Ticked means she does it without asking:

1. Open apps, sites and music
2. Click by position in the picture
3. Shortcuts
4. Close apps and windows
5. Volume and music
6. Shut down, restart, lock, sleep
7. Hold, drag and game keys
8. Send, post, save, confirm
9. Buy, pay, delete, install
10. Send window pictures to the AI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At every level she **never types passwords or card numbers** and **never types commands into a terminal or PowerShell**. See [COMPUTER_CONTROL_TH.md](docs/COMPUTER_CONTROL_TH.md).

### ⚡ Quick asks in chat

Done right away, without a multi-step job:

- **Open:** apps, Steam/Epic games, websites and folders, e.g. *"open Discord, Spotify and Steam"*
- **Close apps:** she asks first
- **Find files:** Windows Search or Spotlight, then open the file or its folder
- **Music:** play a song on Spotify or YouTube; play, pause, skip, volume
- **Google searches and Roblox games**
- **Reminders:** e.g. *"remind me to eat in 20 minutes"*
- **Screenshots, and looking at your screen**

### 📬 Personal assistant: mail and calendar (MCP)

- **Gmail and Google Calendar:** connect them in Settings › **Assistant** with one Google OAuth key file. See [the guide (Thai)](docs/ASSISTANT_TH.md)
- **Ask in chat:** "summarize today's mail", "draft a reply to A", "what's on tomorrow", "book a meeting Wednesday 3 pm"
- **Important mail alerts:** checked every 3 minutes, with a button to open the mail
- **Meeting alerts:** 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes before, with a button to join Meet, Zoom or Teams
- **Always asks first:** anything that sends, deletes or creates (sending mail, creating or deleting events)
- **Any other MCP server:** add it to `mcp.json`, the same shape as Claude Code's, and its tools work in chat

- **To-do list, meeting prep, VIP senders, unanswered mail, meeting conflicts, routines:** see [ASSISTANT_TH.md](docs/ASSISTANT_TH.md)

### 📰 News and daily briefs

- **News on your topics:** from Google News and your own RSS feeds, de-duplicated, summarized by AI on a schedule
- **Breaking news:** an alert at once for your words
- **Morning and evening briefs:** meetings, important mail, open tasks and news, read aloud if you like
- **Models by task:** chat / tools / computer control / background jobs / vision can each use their own model

### 📱 Telegram and Vibecode from your phone

- **Telegram:** text, voice messages, photos and videos; she answers in words or her voice; paired with your chat only
- **Alerts on your phone:** always, or only while you're away (LINE too)
- **Vibecode:** create projects and drive Claude Code or Codex by text, voice or a mockup; approve the agent's permissions on your phone; diff, commit, open a PR
- **The computer from your phone:** screenshots, computer jobs, lock or shut down; off by default and behind a PIN
- See [TELEGRAM_TH.md](docs/TELEGRAM_TH.md)

### 🎵 Music and the mini player

- **Mini player:** bottom right, shows what's playing in Spotify, a browser or any player your system knows, with ⏮ ⏯ ⏭
- **Dancing:** she dances while music plays
- Turn it on or off in Settings › Behavior

### 👨‍💻 Watching your coding AI

Hooks for **Claude Code**, **Codex** and **Antigravity**:

- **Ticker:** what the AI is doing, e.g. `EDITS file.ts`, `RUNS npm test`
- **Waiting for approval:** she teleports to your cursor and points at the window to click
- **Thinking indicator:** so you know it isn't stuck
- **Effects:** an impact when a command fails, a celebration with a mission report when it's done
- **Claude Code or Codex through local Ollama**

### ⚙ Settings and system

- **First run:** a six-step setup: character, AI, voice, mic, coding AI, done
- **Right-click menu:** short, with only what you use every day
- **Settings:** a seven-tab dialog in a cyberpunk theme
- **Hotkeys:** rebindable
- **Reset all settings:** a button you press twice to confirm
- **Updates:**
  - she tells you when a new version is out
  - Windows installs it when you restart
  - a Mac opens the download page
- **Start at login**
- **Error log:** errors go to `errors.txt` instead of crash dialogs

## Windows and Mac

| | Windows | Mac |
|---|---|---|
| Install and updates | updates itself | download by hand (not signed by Apple) |
| Computer control | UI Automation | Accessibility (allow once) |
| Window titles | always | needs Screen Recording |

## Privacy and safety

- The mic starts off every launch
- Wake phrases are checked on your computer
- Every online service needs your consent first
- API keys are encrypted with your user account, never passed to the page and never logged
- Computer control sends only the current job's data to the AI, keeps no pictures, and sends none when a password field is showing
- Screen text is treated as data, never as instructions: she won't do what a web page tells her to
